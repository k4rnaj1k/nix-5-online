# unit 13 hibernate
To launch, run ``start.bat``
or:
 - ``mvn package``
 - ``java -jar target/unit_13_hibernate-1.0.jar``

or: run ``com.k4rnaj1k.Main``

The app can be configured through ``resources/hibernate.cfg.xml``

Just edit the values as needed.

Please note: with current hibernate config, tables are created every time the app is launched. To change this behaviour, edit the ``hibernate.cfg.xml`` file.
